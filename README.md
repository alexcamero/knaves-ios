# knaves-ios
The obscure card game Knaves made for iOS.

This is a work in progress. The game logic, a basic interface, and the ability to play with other nearby iOS devices through Multipeer Connectivity are all complete. I am currently hooking it up to Google Firebase in order to have real multiplayer games.
